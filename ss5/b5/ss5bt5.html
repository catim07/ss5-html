        <h1>5. Groups of selectors</h1>
        <b>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the comma.</b>

            <h2>CSS example:</h2>
            <p><b>In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,</b></p>

            <p>h1 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>

            <p>h3 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
            <br>
